## Things that I've done well?
- Implement AG Grid and AG Chart for the data
- Implement solid state management and routing with redux and react-router-dom respectively.
- Create responsive web page that doesn't break on dimensional changes.
- Well defined project structure for everyone to understand if the next day it gets in the development pipeline.
- Maintaining types while creating reusable components for efficient coding.
- Use popular libraries like Material UI

## Things I could have improved given 4 more hours?
- Fix the planning grid non-functionality of columns - Sales Dollars, GM Dollars, and GM Percent as it is a vital part for the assessment
- Improve the UI
- Implement the Chart
